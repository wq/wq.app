[@wq/model][docs]

**@wq/model** is a [wq.app] module providing a simple API for working with lists, or collections of similar objects.  It integrates with [@wq/app] to load the [ORM configuration], and uses [@wq/store] to retrieve the underlying JSON data from e.g. a [wq.db REST API][wq.db].  @wq/model is based on [Redux-ORM] and provides similar querying capabilities, while also supporting asyncronous APIs for paginating through data from the server.
