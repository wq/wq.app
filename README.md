# wq.app

**wq.app/js** are a collection of Javascript modules for building robust, offline-cabable HTML5 mobile and desktop data collection apps.  Powered by RequireJS, jQuery Mobile, Mustache.js, and [a number of other awesome libraries](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/tree/master/js/lib).  Great for use with [wq.db](https://github.com/wq/wq.db) or any REST service.

**wq.app/css** includes the default stylesheets packaged with jQuery Mobile and Leaflet.  **wq.app/scss** provides a SASS/SCSS stylesheet for use with Compass, with appropriate macros for generating custom jQuery Mobile themes.

**wq.app/util** provides a Python-based build process for compiling wq apps: inlining templates, optimizing code (via r.js), and generating an application cache manifest.
