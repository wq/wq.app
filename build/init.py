    (DEPRECATED) Symlink wq.app's js/css/scss.  This facilitates uisng
    wq.app's assets via short relative paths without vendoring the entire
    wq.app codebase in your project.  A "lib/" folder will be configured for
    each of the three asset types.

    While symbolic links are supported on all modern operating systems, some
    (i.e. Windows) may require administrative access.  After running wq init as
    an administrator, you should be able to continue as a standard user.

    Note: It's best to configure VCS to completely ignore the lib/ entries -
    since they may be different on each computer, and they can be created
    automatically as needed.

    `wq init` will be removed in wq.app 2.0, in favor of
    ./manage.py collectstatic.
